Creative Portion:
- Navbar we created the navbar which is located under the includes portion. We call 'includes navbar.php;' in the includes header which is then added to all of our pages. We wanted to make the navbar dynamic by allowing the user access to all of our links to login, logout, about page, and search

- Darkmode --> The darkmode button can be used invert the theme colors from light to dark. The button is located in the navbar

- Clickable images --> Users can access their target article by clicking on the image of the article. This works for the search filter and the home page.

- Search bar --> The searchbar is located on the navbar and allows user to search for article that contains desired text in either the title or the article content. After clicking the search bar for the entry, a new view will appear with a list of relevant articles. The number of results is also shown in this view.

- Like Button --> A button at the bottom of each article that displays the number of likes and allows the user to increment the number of likes that an article has. The most liked article will be featured as the "breaking news" but for the most liked article.
